 # CSS Flexbox
 **Flexbox** : Modern layout mode in CSS3

**"flex"** is a value for the display property

Replace floats and is much more elegant to work with

Aligns items both horizontal (row) and vertical (column)

Flex items can be re-ordered via CSS, don't have to change our markup

# How it works
        * __display: flex;__ `/* Creates a **"flex container"** */`
        * All direct child elements are **"flex items"

    * `align-items` Align items along the cross axis (Vertical)
    * `aling-content` Align when extra space in cross axis
